  Gatsby starter blog with Lunr.js site search
</h1>

This project is intended in part as a both a learning piece in order to understand how [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) works, but also as a fully functional blog starter with additional site search functionality baked in from the get go.

This project is a fork of Gatsby's [official starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/lukewhitehouse/gatsby-starter-blog-with-lunr
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸŒ’ Using Lunr.js

As part of this project, a blog post named [Gatsby Site Search with Lunr.js](https://assortment.io/posts/gatsby-site-search-lunr-js) was created in order to fork the project from scratch with Gatsby's starter blog. I would recommend reading that to get yourself aquanted.

Aside from that, Lunr also has some [great documentation](https://lunrjs.com/docs/index.html) to help you extend the base functionality found in this project moving forward.
